# plot histogram of pvalues as diagnostic tool
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Histograms of pvalues are really useful diagnostic tools for RNA-seq data analyses. It is best to exclude genes with small counts (baseMean). Draw a histogram of res$pvalue where res$baseMean > 1
  CorrectAnswer: hist(res$pvalue[res$baseMean > 1])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='hist(res$pvalue[res$baseMean > 1])')
  Hint : Try typing hist(res$pvalue[res$baseMean > 1])
  
- Class: figure
  Output: Take a look at the histogram you made!
  Figure: hist.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: text
  Output: Notice how the first bin (with the smallest p-values) contains the most genes. This is the typical distribution we would expect from our data. If the histogram doesn't look similar to this one, we might have to use different statistical tests for different hypotheses.

# count plot for single genes

- Class: text
  Output: Next, we can plot the normalized counts (expression) for single genes across the different experimental conditions. This is really helpful for looking at control genes and assessing the success of the experiment. For example, in a knockdown experiment, you can check if the expression of that gene actually decreased.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For this dataset, let's take a look at IL6. You can use the DESEq2 function plotCounts() to extract and plot counts for specific genes (using the attribute gene=). Try it out!
  CorrectAnswer: plotCounts(dds, gene = "IL6")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plotCounts(dds, gene = "IL6")')
  Hint: Try typing plotCounts(dds, gene = "IL6")
  
- Class: figure
  Output: Take a look at the normalized counts for IL6
  Figure: counts_IL6.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: text_question
  Output: In which condition is IL6 expressed more highly?
  CorrectAnswer: 'treatment'
  AnswerTests: val_matches('[T|t]reatment')
  Hint: It's the treatment, shown on the right side of the plot.
