- Class: text
  Output: The fastq files you obtain from RNA-seq (whether they were deposited online or you are receiving your own new data) will almost always contain some reads or bases with very low quality. Additionally some reads might only cover short RNA fragments, which means that the sequencing adapters used to generated the library are also part of the read sequence. In addition to an introduction to removing these reads or bases, this lesson will cover how to generally asses the quality of RNAseq data in fastq format.

- Class: text
  Output: Assessment of read quality is often performed using the fastQC program. Find out more about this program here - https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/

  # with BiocTerm this could be an expression / command question?
  # is there a way do dynamically determine where the lesson files are & print the corresponding output?
  # -> could also make this a question /command with BiocTerm maybe
  Output: Assume that the fastq files distributed with the previous lesson have beeon copied to your current folder. Give a valid command to run fastQC on the SRR11412215 sample.
  CorrectAnswer: fastqc -f fastq SRR11412215.chr20.fq.gz
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='fastqc -f fastq SRR11412215.chr20.fq.gz')
  Hint: fastqc -f fastq <filename>
  
- Class: text  
  Output: This program will produce a single html report for each fastq file it is run on, it can also be run on multiple files at the same time. An example of such a report is included with the files for this lesson, if you can't run it yourself.
  
- Class: figure
  Output: One of the most important details in the quality report is the average sequencing quality of the reads. The picture shown here is very exemplary and depicts a slightly lower quality at the first few bases of the reads and generally high, but decreasing quality over the length of the average reads.
  Figure: draw_1.R

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Take some time to look at the sequencing quality report. Which positions within the reads appear to have the highest average quality?
  AnswerChoices: positions 1-5;positions 6-19;positions 20-69, positions 75-124;positions 125-150
  CorrectAnswer: positions 6-19
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "positions 6-19")
  Hint: The quality score of the reads is shown on the y-axis. The position in bp within the reads is shown on the x-axis.

- Class: figure
  Output: Another quality measure for RNAseq reads is the distribution of bases over all reads - given the large number of reads generated it should result in mostly random distribution. One common exception is again that the first few sequencing cycles often produce somewhat abberant features.
  Figure: draw_2.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: In which case could a stronger bias for certain bases at the start of the reads be expected, without indicating low read quality?
  AnswerChoices: Reads are barcoded;Readthrough of short reads;Overrepresented sequences
  CorrectAnswer: Reads are barcoded
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Reads are barcoded')
  Hint: Only one of these is not a reason for concern!
  

- Class: figure
  Output: Let's look at the sequence length distribution. Here we can examine if the generated sequence fragments are of uniform or varying lengths. Varing lengths can be cause for concern regarding the sequencing quality, depending on the sequencing platform used.
  Figure: draw_3.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the approximate length of the marjority of sequencing reads?
  AnswerChoices: 30-34bp, 140-144bp, 150-152bp
  CorrectAnswer: 150-152bp
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = '150-152bp')
  Hint: Where is the peak?

- Class: text
  Output: Reads or UMIs (unique molecular identifiers) can sometimes lead to a strong bias in the first few bases of the reads, even though the barcode/UMI sequences should ideally be fully randomised.

- Class: text
  Output: One of the most common problems that can make RNAseq samples virtually unusable for analysis is the overamplification of very few sequences (often from ribosomal RNA), which can then make up a ver large amount of the reads.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's check the full fastqc report distributed with this lesson for overrepresented sequences. To open the html file in your browser, type browseURL(report_html). Take your time exploring the report, then navigate to the section titled "overrepresented sequences".
  CorrectAnswer: browseURL(report_html)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'browseURL(report_html)')
  Hint: Type browseURL(report_html)

# if browser thing doesn't work the data is also loaded as overrepresentedSequences

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is there a reason for concern regarding overamplification of certain sequences with this sample?
  AnswerChoices: Yes, the presence of overrepresented sequences is a concern;No, contribution of overrepresented Sequences is negligible;No, only overrepresneted ribosomal RNA is a reason for concern
  CorrectAnswer: No, contribution of overrepresented sequences is negligible

  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'No, contribution of overrepresented Sequences is negligible')
  Hint: FastQC checks each sample for the most common sequences and checks them against a small database of known sequences.
  
- Class: text
  Output: As with many automated tools, fastQC will almost always detect some sequences that are represnted more often than other in a given ssample, however minor contributions of sequences is usually normal. In doubt blast the sequences to see what the might be!
  
- Class: text
  Output: If fastqc detects a high amount of low quality reads or reads with an high adapter content, it is necessary to remove these low quality reads or read-parts from the data.

  Output: The example data of this lesson is generally of high quality, but in many cases some samples have low quality reads that should be trimmed and of course all samples need to be processed the same way. A good program to perfrom read trimming is trim_galore. With which command could you perform trimming of the SRR11412215 sample?  
  CorrectAnswer: trim_galore SRR11412215.chr20.fq.gz
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='trim_galore SRR11412215.chr20.fq.gz')
  Hint: trim_galore <filename>

- Class: text
  Output: trim_galore has a lot of options, however it will usually a quite good good even with default parameters. One important thing to remeber is to pass the --paired options if you have paired-end files. The other options often start becoming relevant when you need to handle specific problems or particularities of the samples.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Check the options or trim_galore (trim_galore --help). Which of the following measures can the program not utilize to remove reads?

  AnswerChoices: Overlap with known contaminants;Minimal read length;Maximal read length;Read Quality
  CorrectAnswer: Overlap with known contaminants
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Overlap with known contaminants')
  Hint: trim_galore reads on the fastq file with all its contained information.
