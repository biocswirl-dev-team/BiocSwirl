  Version: 2.4.5

- Class: text
  Output: This lesson will cover the basics of how and where RNAseq data is deposited and how to access it.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Because the actual raw data produced by RNA sequencing depends on the technology used and often contains multiple mixed samples, it is not very feasible to store and distribute these files directly. Instead the files that are most commonly used as raw data are FASTQ files.

- Class: text_question
  Output: Fastq files are very similar to fasta files, which are used to store multiple sequences in one file. Similarly fastq files store the raw sequences of the reads, but they do more than that. What additional information does a fastq file contain?
  CorrectAnswer: Quality
  AnswerTests: val_matches('[Q|q]uality')
  Hint: What could the 'q' stand for? RNA sequencing is not perfect and can make errors!
  
- Class: text
  Output: Because fastq files are the raw data upon which all RNA-seq analysis is built, they are often deposited online and made available to other researchers and the general public. This good practice and not only makes science more approachabale and reproducible, but also allows anyone to use such data for further projects.
  
- Class: text_question
  Output: The most important database for RNA-seq datasets is NCBI's GEO database. Look up the GEO accession GSE147507 on the NCBI website. What is the title of that accession?
  CorrectAnswer: Transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'Transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection')
  Hint: The accession can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147507, but just searching for GSE147507 on the web should be sufficient to find it.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which data files can you find directly on the page of the GSE147507 accession?
  AnswerChoices: Fastq files;Raw count data;Pre-Processed count data;None of the above
  CorrectAnswer: Raw count data
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Raw count data')
  Hint: Check the 'Supplementary file' section on the webpage

- Class: text
  Output: In order to the database IDs of individual fastq files belonging to a GEO entry (which describes the whole dataset), we have to go to the associated enties of the SRA (sequence read archive).  The SRA run selector will let us select and filter individual samples from the datasets.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: How many samples for the human cell line NHBE are there in this dataset?
  CorrectAnswer: 24
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 24)
  Hint: Activate the filters for 'Cell_Line' and 'Organism' on the top left of the webpage.

- Class: text
  Output: While the SRA run selector allows you to filter and select specific samples you may be interest in, it does not actually allow you to download the fastq files directly. To get the fastq files you first need to download a list of the SRR accession IDs. These IDs can be used by programs the SRA toolkit (mainly prefetch and fastq-dump) to diretcly download the fastq-files from the NCBI servers. Further information on how to use the SRA toolkit to download data from NCBI can be found on its documentation 'https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc' For the remaining lessons dealing with fastq files, you should use the data supplied with this course, which are 6 samples from the GSE147507 dataset, but only contain reads belonging to a simple chromosome to reduce file size & analysis runtime.

- Class: text
  Output: Take a look at the fastq files - the command "less" is highly recommended since it can look into the files even when they are compressed to reduce file size.


- Class: exact_question
  Output: A fastq file usually has many entries - one for each sequence. How many lines are there for each entry?
  CorrectAnswer: 4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=4)
  Hint: An entry is composed of a header, the base sequence, a second header or spacer, and the sequence quality for each base

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The sequence quality for each entry is not encoded in the file with numbers, how is the quality for each read written in the file?
  AnswerChoices: Hexadecimal single digits for each base;Quality for the whole read encoded in a text-string;Various ASCII characters represent quality for each base
  CorrectAnswer: Various ASCII characters represent quality for each base
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Various ASCII characters represent quality for each base')
  Hint: Compare the length of the quality and sequence strings for each entry and see which characters are used overall in the file

- Class: text
  Output: Dependening the sequencing strategy used by a given experiment you can either have one (single-end sequencing) or two (paired-end sequencing) fastq files for each sample. The samples for this course used single-end sequencing so there is only one file per sample. The GEO database will also always denote whether samples are single- or paired-end and the SRA toolkit will automatically download both fastq files for paired-end samples. It is important to keep in mind whether your data is single- or paired-end, because many commands for later analysis steps change a bit if you have two files per sample.
