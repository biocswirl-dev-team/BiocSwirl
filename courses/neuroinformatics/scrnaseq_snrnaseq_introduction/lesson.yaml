  Lesson: Differences between snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq, an introduction
  Author: Elizabeth Hutchins
  Type: Standard
  Version: 1.0

#Introduction

- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to the lesson on snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq. Most tools and workflows are written for scRNA-seq data, but there are some differences on the analysis end, particularly in some quality control metrics that are frequently used with scRNA-seq sofrware. This lesson will help you identify characteristics of snRNA-seq data to be aware of for analysis. For this lesson, we will assume that you have already finished the low-level analyses lessons in the scRNA-seq course.

#Dataset

- Class: text
  Output: "The dataset used in this lesson, which contains scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, and bulk RNA-seq data from mouse visual cortex, is from Bakken et al., 2018, Single-nucleus and single-cell transcriptomes compared in matched cortical cell types, doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209648. The data was pulled from the following github repo: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/NucCellTypes."

#Mitochondrial rRNA content

- Class: text
  Output: Mitochondrial rRNA content is often included as part of data filtering with scRNA-seq data in tools such as Seurat; low quality/dying cells often exhibit mitochondrial contamination.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which method results in cells with a higher mitochondrial rRNA content?
  AnswerChoices: scRNA-seq;snRNA-seq
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='scRNA-seq')
  Hint: group by the "Type" column and summarize the mean of the "percent_reads_aligned_to_mt_rrna" column.

#Unique genes detected, doublets

- Class: text
  Output: The number of genes detected in a single cell is often used as a quality control metric by programs such as Seurat; too high of a number of genes indicates that a doublet may have been captured instead of a singlet.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: What is the mean number of genes detected by snRNA-seq? Round to the nearest integer.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='4981')
  Hint: group by the "Type" column and summarize the mean of the "Genes.detected" column.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: What is the mean number of genes detected by scRNA-seq? Round to the nearest integer.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='9313')
  Hint: group by the "Type" column and summarize the mean of the "Genes.detected" column.

#Exonic/intronic/intergenic percent

- Class: text
  Output: Another metric often examined in RNA-seq data is the percent of reads aligning to exonic and intronic regions of genes.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which method has a higher percentage of reads aligning to intronic regions of genes?
  AnswerChoices: scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='snRNA-seq')
  Hint: group by the "Type" column and summarize the mean of the percent_reads_aligned_to_introns column.
