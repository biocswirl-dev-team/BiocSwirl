  Lesson: Differences between snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq
  Author: Elizabeth Hutchins
  Type: Standard
  Version: 1.0

#Introduction

- Class: text
  Output: "Welcome to the lesson on snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq in seurat. This lesson further explores differences between scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq datasets. We are following the seurat tutorial here: https://scrnaseq-course.cog.sanger.ac.uk/website/seurat-chapter.html."

- Class: text
  Output: For this lesson, we will assume that you have already finished the scrna-snrna introduction lesson.

#Dataset

- Class: text
  Output: "The dataset used in this lesson, which contains scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, and bulk RNA-seq data from mouse visual cortex, is from Bakken et al., 2018, Single-nucleus and single-cell transcriptomes compared in matched cortical cell types, doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209648. The data was pulled from the following github repo: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/NucCellTypes."

- Class: text
  Output: The "sampAll" object contains sample metrics, and the "countR" object contains raw counts.

- Class: text
  Output: Now that you have explored some of the differences between snRNA-Seq data and scRNA-Seq data, you will run both datasets (counts are in the "countsR" object) through seurat - QC, cluster cells, and generate UMAP plots for both datasets. Sample names and types corresponding to the count table are in the sampAll object. "exp_component_name" are the sample names and "Type" are the type of dataset.
