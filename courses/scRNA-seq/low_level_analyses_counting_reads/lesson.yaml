# Counting reads

- Class: text
  Output: From the aligned sequence BAM files and a list of genomic features, we can now count how many reads map to each feature. First we must obtain the list which contains annotated genomic features.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following file types contain annotated genomic features?
  AnswerChoices: SAM, BAM, VCF, GTF, PDF
  CorrectAnswer: GTF
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='GTF')
  Hint: Starts with the letter after F.

- Class: text
  Output: General Transfer Format (GTF) files generally contain the chromosome number, the feature type name, and the nucleotide start/end position of the feature. Find and download your specific species from the Ensembl FTP Downloads https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html.

- Class: text
  Output: Once the GTF file is downloaded, read counting can proceed. htseq-count is a python script that outputs a table with counts for each feature. Follow https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.11.1/install.html for installation instructions.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Write a function that counts the features of a BAM input file, skipping all reads with alignment quality lower than 10. For the file names, use  'sample.gtf' and count all bam files
  CorrectAnswer: htseq-count -f bam -a *.bam sample.gtf
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='htseq-count -f bam -a *.bam sample.gtf')
  Hint: Make sure the correct options are used. Recall the bash wildcard when searching for a pattern to return all BAM files.

# Remove low read counts

- Class: text
  Output: Raw single-cell data is noisy in that read counts contain many genes with zero counts or insignificantly low count numbers. We will be filtering these low counts before proceeding to differential gene expression.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: For less than how many counts should genes be filtered out?
  AnswerChoices: 1;5;10;20;it depends
  CorrectAnswer: it depends
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='it depends')
  Hint: Nothing is certain...

- Class: text
  Output: The filter threshold will depend on the differential expression algorithm that is being used. Refer to the specific differential expression vignette for details.

- Class: script
  Output: Write a function to filter out all features with less than 10 total counts in the object 'table'.
  AnswerTests: low_filter()
  Hint: Use function to filter sum of total counts across a row.
  Script: low_filter.R
