#Explain alignment

- Class: text
  Output: The first step of analysis is to align these FASTQ files to a reference.

- Class: text
  Output: There are many open source and commercial alignment tools with varying sensitivities and speeds. Which aligner you choose to use depends on available computing power and the acceptable trade-off between accuracy and speed. Commonly used aligners include BWA, Bowtie2, HISAT2, Bfast, and Stampy. In this lesson, we will be using Bowtie2

- Class: text
  Output: Using bioconductor, please install Rbowtie2 (if you are not familiar with installation using bioconductor, take a look at that lesson first!). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Open a new project in R and install Rbowtie2.
  CorrectAnswer: install.packages("BiocManager")
  AnswerTests: omnitest('BiocManager::install("Rbowtie2")')
  Hint: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rbowtie2.html

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: After installation, make sure to load your package using the "library" function. 
  CorrectAnswer: library("Rbowtie2")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(library("Rbowtie2"))
  Hint: The format should be "library(__"packageName"__)


- Class: text
  Output: In addition to needing the software, it is also necessary to have a reference genome to align your reads to. Each species will have its own reference, and most softwares require the reference to be formatted in a software specific way. While it is possible to generate your own bowtie2 reference, that is beyond the scope of this lesson.  Bowtie2 distributes a copy of the mouse and human reference genomes on their website. Please download the most recent mouse reference (mm10) from the bowtie2 website, and save it to an easily accessible folder, before proceeding to the next step!


#Status Check

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that we've collected all of the pieces to begin your analysis, it's time to run some alignments! Before we proceed, do you have your raw reads, reference genome, and bowtie2 installed?Type 'yes' if you do, and if not get what you need and type it to proceed!
  CorrectAnswer: yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest('yes')
  Hint: If you need the reference still, it can be found at http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml in the "Indexes" section


#Run Alignment

- Class: text
  Output: Now we're going to align this data to our reference genome. You must align both your treatment and your input to the reference genome, one at a time. The format to the bowtie2 command for paired end reads is as follows, bowtie2(bt2Index, samOutput, seq1, seq2). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, try aligning your treatment file! Save this to a file called treatment.sam
  CorrectAnswer: bowtie2("", treatment.sam,"","")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(bowtie2("", treatment.sam,"",""))
  Hint: For ease of use, put all of the files we're using today in the same working directory. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now align your input control! Save this to a file called input.sam
  CorrectAnswer: bowtie2("", input.sam,"","")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(bowtie2("", input.sam,"",""))
  Hint: For ease of use, put all of the files we're using today in the same working directory.
