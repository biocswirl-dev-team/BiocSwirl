  Output: In the previous tutorial, you learned how to navigate the RStudio interface and ran your first bits of R code. You should now be familair with operators like `+` (mathematical) and `==` (logical) as well as functions like `sqrt()`. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Don't worry: you don't have to remember every function and their respective arguments (_i.e._ inputs). You can use Google and the R help pages for this, like every other data scientist. "
  
- Class: text
  Output: Today, we're going to take a look at what data looks like in R. Each programming language organizes their data in different ways. These are known as data structures. This tutorial will focus on the most important data structure in R, the data frame, and its key component, the vector. These data structures are fundamental to data science in R, so pay close attention. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: You will be exploring the Canadian COVID-19 statistics for the first six months of 2020. The data was originally downloaded from the [EU Open Data Portal](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data). It was lightly processed for this tutorial. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Data Frames!
  
# Loading Data frames
- Class: text
  Output: "Let's start by loading the data. You will learn more about this process in a future tutorial. For now, you are going to simply load the data from the Internet and preview it. The `read.csv()` function can take a file path or a URL and returns a data frame. Let's see it in action!"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try typing 'covid <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/cov-ca")'
  CorrectAnswer: covid <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/cov-ca")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='covid <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/cov-ca")')
  Hint: Just type covid <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/cov-ca")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, look at the data we loaded and assigned to 'covid'
  CorrectAnswer: covid
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='covid')
  Hint: Just type covid
  
- Class: text
  Output: "As you can see, a data frame is nothing more than a two-dimensional table consisting of rows and columns. This one has six rows (one for each month) and five columns. The columns contain different types of information: either integers or text. In many respects, data frames look like Excel tables. However, data frames in R are strictly rectangular. Every column has the same length, and the same rule applies to rows. This doesn't mean you can't have missing data. Rather, you will see missing data indicated by the value `NA` (not seen here in `covid`)."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Class (and the function 'class()') is another way to refer to what kind of data structure is stored in a variable. Here, we can confirm that the `covid` variable contains a data frame. Use the class() function to confirm.
  CorrectAnswer: class(covid)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(covid)')
  Hint: Try typing 'class(covid)'
  
# Exploring the data frame
- Class: text
  Output: "As we saw in the previous tutorial, functions can be very useful. In fact, there are a number of functions that work well with data frames. Notably, the `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions can be used to count the number of rows and columns in the input, respectively. Admittedly, this is more useful with larger datasets."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try the function "ncol()" on our covid data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: ncol(covid)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ncol(covid)')
  Hint: Try typing 'ncol(covid)'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try the function "nrow()" on our covid data frame
  CorrectAnswer: nrow(covid)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='nrow(covid)')
  Hint: Try typing 'nrow(covid)'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Another useful function is called `summary()` which will display statistics for numeric columns and tabulate values in text columns. Try it out!
  CorrectAnswer: summary(covid)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(covid)')
  Hint: Try typing 'summary(covid)'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The `head()` and `tail()` functions are useful for extracting the first or last few rows in a data frame. These are especially useful for larger data frames. Try using head(). 
  CorrectAnswer: head(covid)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(covid)')
  Hint: Try typing 'head(covid)'
  
- Class: text
  Output: Vectors!

# Performing Operations on Vectors 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "That's enough boring stuff for now. Let's start actually handling the data. The most basic operation you can do with a data frame is extracting a column. There are several ways of doing this, but the simplest is the `$` operator. For example, if we want to extract the `cases` column, which contains the number of new COVID-19 cases during each month in Canada. You can clearly see the rapid increase in cases and eventual plateau once social distancing slowed down the outbreak. Try it out!"
  CorrectAnswer: covid$cases
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='covid$cases')
  Hint: Try typing 'covid$cases'

- Class: text
  Output: "It might be surprising to see the column laid out horizontally. That's because it's no longer considered a column of the data frame after we use the `$` operator. Specifically, columns consist of a data structure known as a vector."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Vectors can contain multiple elements. E.g. in the case of covid$cases, it contains multiple integers. R allows for some functions and operations to be applied to each element of the vector. This is called vectorization. Try dividing each element in the vector covid$cases by 1000 and assigning the result to covd$cases_1000, which will create a new column in the data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: covid$cases_1000 <- covid$cases / 1000
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='covid$cases_1000 <- covid$cases/1000')
  Hint: Try typing 'covid$cases_1000 <- covid$cases / 1000'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's check our work by recalling the covid data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: covid
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='covid')
  Hint: Try typing 'covid'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Vectorization also works with pasting strings and elements from the vectors together. Try typing 'paste("Canada had", covid$cases_1000, "thousand cases in", covid$month)' and see what happens!
  CorrectAnswer: paste("Canada had", covid$cases_1000, "thousand cases in", covid$month)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='paste("Canada had", covid$cases_1000, "thousand cases in", covid$month)')
  Hint: Copy the command from the question!
  
# Types of vectors
- Class: text
  Output: "Some operations on vectors might fail. For example this one 'covid$month + covid$cases_1000' will produce the following error: 'non-numeric argument to binary operator'"
 
- Class: text
  Output: This error came up because we tried to add up two different types of vectors. There are six different types of vectors in total. Vectors can contain integers (abbreviated to 'int'), numeric elements ('num'), strings or characters ('chr'), logical elements (TRUE/FALSE) ('logi'), raw sequences of bytes ('raw'), or complex values ('cplx').
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: With the function typeof() you can find out what type of vector you're working with. Try it out on covid$cases!
  CorrectAnswer: typeof(covid$cases)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='typeof(covid$cases)')
  Hint: Try typing 'typeof(covid$cases)'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The function str() will compactly display the structure of an R object. If you use it on 'covid', you will see what type of vector each column of the data frame is. Try it out!
  CorrectAnswer: str(covid)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(covid)')
  Hint: Try typing 'str(covid)'
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which type of vector is covid$month?
  AnswerChoices: complex;raw;integer;numeric;logical;character
  CorrectAnswer: character
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'character')
  Hint: Check the output of 'str(covid)'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can create vectors of any type using the function vector(). The argument 'mode' describes the type of vector, the argument length describes how many elements the vector should contain. Try creating a character vector with 3 elements and assign it to 'new_vector'. You can type ?vector() for more information about the function.
  CorrectAnswer: new_vector <- vector(mode = "character", length = 3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'new_vector <- vector(mode = "character", length = 3)')
  Hint: Try typing 'new_vector <- vector(mode = "character", length = 3)'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now look at your newly created vector with str().
  CorrectAnswer: str(new_vector)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'str(new_vector)')
  Hint: Try typing 'str(new_vector)'
