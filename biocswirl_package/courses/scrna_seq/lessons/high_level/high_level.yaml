#Introduction

- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to the lesson on High level Analyses. This lesson will cover how to conduct high level analyses using clustering methods, differential expression to obtain genes with high expression and so on.
  
#Clustering methods

- Class: text
  Output: K-means and K-medoids analysis are done once the low-level analysis is complete i.e. the data should be properly aligned, normalized and any genes with low expression values be removed. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: For our lesson, we will assume that you have already finished the low-level analyses and are learning about high-level analyses.
  
- Class: text
  Output: For this lesson, we will make use of SC3, although other tools for clustering like Seurat and SINCERA can also be used for clustering.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Load the packages for clustering analysis.
  CorrectAnswer: library("")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library("")')
  Hint: Load pcaMethods, SC3, scater, SingleCellExperiment, mclust, pheatmap.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Run a simple PCA analysis on your dataset by a specific cell type.
  CorrectAnswer: plotPCA("___", colour_by = "___")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plotPCA("___", colour_by = "___")')
  Hint: Enter the name of the object created by SingleCellExperiment library

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Estimate number of clusters for SC3
  CorrectAnswer: sc3_estimate_k("___")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sc3_estimate_k("___")')
  Hint: Enter the name of the object created by SingleCellExperiment library
